> _Classification: Top Secret_  
> _Clearance Level: Black Ops_  
> _Mission Directive: Execute without a trace._

## 🕶️ Mission Briefing

ZeroTrace is a covert C++ utility engineered to silently and efficiently transfer data between high-value containers. Using advanced vector-to-list conversion techniques, ZeroTrace ensures seamless operations during high-risk data manipulations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Infiltrate vector data structures.  
- Extract and deploy data into list-based containers.  
- Operate without detection, leaving no memory artifacts behind.  
- Execute operations with minimal latency for mission-critical tasks.

## 💻 Technology

- **Language:** C++  
- **Standard:** C++11 and beyond  
- **Modules:** `<vector>`, `<list>`, `<iostream>`

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository from the secure vault (GitHub):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ZeroTrace.git
```

## 🗡️ Execution

Run your covert operation:

```bash
g++ zerotrace.cpp -o zerotrace
./zerotrace
```

## 🧰 Features

- 🔄 **Vector to List Conversion**: Smooth data exfiltration from dynamic arrays to linked containers.
- 🕵️ **Stealth Mode**: Clean memory handling—no leaks, no trails.
- ⚡ **Rapid Deployment**: Fast and efficient data structure manipulation.

## ⚠️ Warning

> _Unauthorized use of ZeroTrace outside approved black-ops simulations is strictly prohibited._
