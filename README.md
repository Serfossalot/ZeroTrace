ZeroTrace Terminal Utility (ZT_Term)
Mission Briefing 🕶️
ZeroTrace Terminal (ZT_Term) is a covert C++ terminal utility simulating an agent tool for secure payload extraction and vector-to-list data conversion.

Interactive, loop-driven terminal interface

Accepts user-defined payloads (integers) and transfers them from vector to linked list format

Spy-themed output and banner to enhance immersion

Modular design with reusable display and payload functions

Continuous missions until agent aborts the operation

🔍 Features
Stylized terminal interface with banners and immersive mission flow

Custom payload loader: input mission-critical data into a vector

Covert vector → list extraction using STL containers

Looping functionality for repeated extractions or exit by agent command

Modular code structure for easy upgrades

🎯 Objectives
Launch ZT_Term

Enter payload size and values

Visualize payload transfer from vector to linked list

Repeat extraction or abort mission
